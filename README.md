# Feeld Magic Site

## Information/Important
- **For mac users don't use Safari as it causes problems and it won't work**
- This will only work if registered via **email** - it doesn't support the third party logins like `Apple`, `Facebook` & `Google` (You should be able to add a normal email by opening the app, going to the accounts tab > `App settings` > `Email`)
- Settings won't ever include an option to upload pictures because i don't want to help catfishing/bots
